in powerBI Mostly tables are in verticle format and not in horizontal format now if interviewer asked me to transform verticle table into horizontal table how do i gonna do it



In Power BI, to transform a vertical table into a horizontal format, I would use the Pivot Column feature in Power Query Editor. I’d go to Transform Data, select the column that I want to pivot 
(usually the column that has repeating values which should become new column headers), and then use the Pivot Column option. I would choose the appropriate values column to fill the data under the new headers. 
This effectively turns row values into columns, making the table horizontal. It’s useful when we want to compare categories side by side or create a crosstab format.

Example for better understanding:

If I have a vertical table like this:

Product	Month	Sales
A	Jan	100
A	Feb	120
B	Jan	90
B	Feb	110

And I want to transform it so that each product has its own row and months become columns:

Product	Jan	Feb
A	100	120
B	90	110

I would:

Open Power Query Editor.

Select the Month column.

Click Transform > Pivot Column.

For the values column, choose Sales.
