Data Mining in Power BI 

Data mining in Power BI involves analyzing large datasets to discover patterns, trends, and insights. Power BI helps users prepare data using Power Query, create calculated metrics using DAX, and visualize results through interactive dashboards. It supports basic forecasting, clustering, and key influencer analysis.
For advanced data mining, Power BI can integrate with R, Python, and Azure Machine Learning to apply predictive models and machine learning algorithms.

Power Query Editor 

Power Query Editor is a data transformation tool in Power BI that allows users to connect, clean, transform, and shape data before loading it into the Power BI model. It provides a user-friendly, no-code interface to perform tasks like:

Removing duplicates or null values
Filtering rows and columns
Merging or appending tables
Changing data types
Splitting or combining columns
Creating custom columns with formulas
Every action in Power Query is recorded as a step, making it easy to track and modify the transformation process.
