Cardinality in Power BI defines the relationship between tables based on data uniqueness. The main types are:

One-to-One: Unique values in both tables.
One-to-Many: One table has unique values; the other has duplicates.
Many-to-Many: Both tables have duplicates.

It impacts how tables relate and how filters and visuals behave in reports.


In Power BI, the * symbol represents the "many" side of a relationship.
One-to-Many (1:*): One table has unique values (1), and the other has repeating values (*).
Many-to-Many (:): Both tables have duplicate values; Power BI shows * : * to indicate this.
These symbols help you understand how data connects and flows between tables in the model.


Cross filter direction in Power BI controls how filters move between tables.    (Excel mai nhi hota hai yeh)
Single: Filter flows one way (e.g., from Customer to Sales).
Both: Filter flows both ways (useful for complex models or slicers).
Use Single for simple models and Both only when needed to avoid confusion or slowdowns.
